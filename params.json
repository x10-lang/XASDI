Set up build environment\r\n  - Java Development Kit (JDK) 6 or later (JDK 8 is recommended)\r\n  - Ant 1.9.6 or later\r\n  - X10 2.5.4\r\n      - Download a prebuilt binary for your platform from http://x10-lang.org/releases/x10-release-254.html\r\n      - After downloading, untar and see the INSTALL file for further instructions.\r\n2. cd src\r\n3. execute ./build.sh\r\n\r\n\r\n### Building and running a sample XASDI application\r\n1. Set up build environment (if not yet done)\r\n2. cd MySample\r\n3. ant\r\n4. execute ./run-Sample.sh\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information for developing your own application\r\nRefer to the XASDI Application Development Guide and API javadoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\nXASDI is licensed to You under the Eclipse Public License (EPL).\r\nYou may not use XASDI except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\nhttp://www.opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sponsor\r\nThis project is supported by [CREST](http://www.jst.go.jp/kisoken/crest/en/index.html), Japan Science and Technology Agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Feedback\r\nPlease feel free to submit your feedback or requests as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/x10-lang/xasdi/issues).\r\n",
