## X10-based Agent Simulation on Distributed Infrastructure (XASDI)


### About XASDI
XASDI is a platform for a massive agent-based simulation and is written in [the X10 programming language](http://x10-lang.org/).
In XASDI, an agent manager manages agents that are executed asynchronously in each place.
An agent in a place can communicate with an agent in another place by sending a communication message.

2. cd src
3. execute ./build.sh


### Building and running a sample XASDI application
1. Set up build environment (if not yet done)
2. cd MySample
3. ant
4. execute ./run-Sample.sh
